This project replicates a chart from the Financial Times (June 2025) that highlights the recent breakdown in the historical correlation between the U.S. dollar and Treasury yields. 
It includes a 30-day rolling correlation analysis and a short review of relevant academic literature.

**Objective**
**Replicate the FT chart using:**
- Daily 10-year Treasury yield from FRED
- Broad U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), normalized
- Highlight correlation shift post-April 2025

**Structure:**
notebooks/: Jupyter notebook for figure replication
figures/: Final images and plots
literature/: Brief reviews of related research papers
data/: Data from FRED

**Literature Reviewed**
Yan (2024): Weak long-term correlation (ARIMA/VAR analysis)
Ahmed & Rebucci (2022): Foreign flows drive Treasury yields; possible second-order link to USD strength
